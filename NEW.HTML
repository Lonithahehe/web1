<h2><u><i>Photography: Capturing Moments, Telling Stories</h2></i></u>
<p><justify>Photography is both an art and a science—the practice of capturing light to create lasting images. From its early days of chemical processes and glass plates to today’s digital sensors and smartphones, photography has evolved into a powerful medium of expression, documentation, and communication.

Whether used to preserve personal memories, report news, promote products, or explore abstract ideas, photography bridges reality and creativity. It encompasses a wide range of styles and purposes—portrait, landscape, street, fashion, wildlife, and fine art photography are just a few of the many genres.

At its core, photography teaches us to see. It invites us to notice details, understand light, frame stories, and express emotion. With accessible tools and growing platforms for sharing, anyone can become a photographer and contribute to the ever-expanding visual language of the modern world.
